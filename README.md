One day a long time ago there was a  
geniues level mathmetician  named Albert Einstein.
He was inventing a new type of
madness lab project
that revolutionized 
a new way to chew gum 
but unfortunately Mr. Einstein got
addicted to cocaine due to drinking Coca-cola,
which was accomplished with the help of a St. Louis, Mo. based company,
 Mallinckrodt.
 Then the dragon came soaring in and burn down the entire village.
 What village you say? It was the village of Mallinckrodt! They had a hidden village in the company grounds!
